            <h2>Need help deciding?</h2>
            <p>Election day is approaching quickly, yet many voters are struggling to decide 
                which ballot to cast when the day comes. Making an educated vote has always 
                been a challenging task, but the spontaneity of a snap election and the chaos 
                of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic make the political climate in Canada even more 
                difficult to comprehend. With this in mind, we created a quiz that can help voters 
                determine which parties their political views align with the most. However, it 
                must be noted that the results of a short quiz cannot compare to the value of 
                informing oneself through in-depth research and discussion. After taking the quiz, 
                we encourage you to follow the links below in order to learn more about the major parties 
                and their values.</p>
